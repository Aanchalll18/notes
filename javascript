1. What are the data types in JavaScript?

JavaScript has primitive types like string, number, boolean, null, undefined, bigint, and symbol, and non-primitive or reference types like object, array, and function.


2. Explain the difference between undefined and null?

undefined means a variable has been declared but not assigned a value. null is an intentional assignment that represents "no value".

3. How does JavaScript handle types?

JavaScript is dynamically typed, meaning variables can hold any type, and the type can change at runtime. It also uses type coercion, converting between types when necessary.

4. What are truthy and falsy values in JavaScript?

Truthy values evaluate to true in a boolean context (e.g., 'hello', 1, []). Falsy values include false, 0, '', null, undefined, and NaN.

5. What is the difference between == and ===?

== is the loose equality operator; it performs type coercion. === is strict equality; it checks both value and type.

6. Explain hoisting in JavaScript.
Hoisting is JavaScriptâ€™s default behavior of moving declarations to the top of the scope before code execution. var declarations and function declarations are hoisted.

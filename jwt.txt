A JSON Web Token (JWT) is a standard used to securely transmit information between a client (like a frontend application) and a server (the backend). 

The data in a JWT, such as user details, is stored in a simple JSON format.

Header: Contains metadata about the token, such as the algorithm used for signing.
Payload: Stores the claims, i.e., data being transmitted.
Signature: Ensures the tokenâ€™s integrity and authenticity.
